# Deep Learning Projects & Algorithm Implementations

#### This repository contains all the DL (Deep Learning) projects and algorithm implementations.

#### 1. Plagiarism Detector
- Built a plagiarism detector that examines a text file and performs binary classification; labeling that file as either *plagiarized* or *not*, depending on how similar that text file is to a provided source text. Detecting plagiarism is an active area of research; the task is non-trivial and the differences between paraphrased answers and original work are often not so obvious.
- Did data exploration,feature engineering and trained/deployed model on AWS.
- Used AWS SageMaker, Scikit-learn and PyTorch
